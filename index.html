                who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
                intro course and found it incredibly fun. The next 12 weeks was
                the best-and the most grueling-time of my life. Since completing
                the course, i've successfully switched careers, working as a

            "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structures from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of their's who can easily say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project in particular was outstanding, it took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. in fact, i've often refer to it during interviews as an
            example of my development experience. It certainly helped me to land
            a job as a full stack developer after receiving multiple offer. 100$
            recommend!"
